On Episode 5 of Up Right & Better, Jill Nelson, founder and CEO of business communications company Ruby Receptionists, shares with us her guiding principles for developing an employee-centric culture that in turn makes her company one of the most awarded in Portland!

Welcome back to Up Right & Better, the podcast where we talk about growing businesses up into the right, and up and better. On this show, it’s not just about scaling for scaling’s sake. It’s about making organizations that deliver value to everyone involved. I’m your host, Kristen Gallagher. Today’s guest is someone I had the opportunity to meet a few months ago at a women led un-conference here in Portland. I’m absolutely honored to have her on the podcast. From humble beginnings 14 years ago, Jill Nelson has grown Ruby Receptionist into a four-time winner of Fortune Magazine’s Top Five Best Small Companies to Work For, and a Portland’s Business Journal’s Fastest Growing Company and Oregon recipient for the past nine years. Today Ruby’s 400 employees provide friendly, live receptionist service to more than 6,000 small businesses throughout North America.
